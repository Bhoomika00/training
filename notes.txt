Angular modeule is different from js modules.
    js files we create in node project are jsavscript modules.
    But in Angular, modules are container on the page.
    every angular app has at least one module which is named as aPP module or root module when we create angular app.

MVc in angular
    Model: includes entity/class(ts file)
    view :template (html file)
    contoller: includes components(component=ts class+html template+metadata)

decorators: are js functions and take object and will tell the angular how to treat the class(annotations) 

@Component({

    selector:'',    //element to be refered by which name to put in main html or index.html
    templateUrl:' ',    //url of html file. 
    stylesUrls:['']      //there can be multiple styles url
})

@Component({
    selector:'',
    template:'<h1>Hello world</h1>'
})

String interpolation :{{ }}

components are also called as  the directives of view or template.
